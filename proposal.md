## Description
I want to be able to create/generate an image that will display a recongnizable flower of some sort. 
Whether it be from manually drawing it or letting the program generate the image by it's self.


## Features
- Feature 1
	- I want it to feature an array of rgb colors, preferabley with some shades of pink added somewhere throughout the 	  piece. A kind of Hello Kitty inspired color palette. 
- Feature 2
	- For the flower itself, I want itnto have at least five petals. The flower's position will either be close up on 	  the right side of the screen or in the center.  
- Feature 3 
	- I want to add some text in the top center or top left of the image/screen, that either says my name "daisy" or 	 some other quote of some kind

## Challenges
- I'm still not sure if I want the image to actaully move as well. If I did, for drawing to appear, I would have to learn 
  more about the Turtle function that creates shapes.
- For the colors, I would need to learn how to better use positioning with (x,y) and how to best excute this.
- I would have learn/research what kinds of texts I should use and how to apply them.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I want there to be a flower set to the side (or center), the backfround to maybe have some type of clouds and grass of some sort, and be colored. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Some flower is made and there is color on it, if not a complex background then just a pink one. Then finally just some kind of text somewhere on the page.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Getting a flower shape to a screen. 
  2. Creating what I want for the background

- Week 2
  1. Deciding a color palette 
  2. Deciding a text and font.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Final touches on how flowers are positioned.
  2. Filling up space if needed.
