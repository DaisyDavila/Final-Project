## Description
This program has generative flowers, specifically Daisies, that appear in a line for the user to place yellow buds in the middle of them. With the limit of three clicks, the program will then notify the user they have ran out of clicks to use. This program was originally going to have much more to see than jus three flowers in a row and placing flower buds but I wasn't able to work it out. In my work, I always try to incorporate flowers in some sort of way since my name is Daisy! Even in my personal work outside of class, I draw myself with Daisy coming out of my head or some times just a literal Daisy with a face! It's silly but it's what has been my go to thought process for a while and it has now followed me to college. Going forward I would like to try my original idea for the project and make a more cutesy route and more stylized like I mentioned in my proposal. As well has filling up the background a bit more to give more depth!
